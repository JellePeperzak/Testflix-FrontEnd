VIEW SWITCHING
- On netflix, the URLS are as follows:
    - Front page: www.netflix.com/browse
    - Series/Movies/Subgenres page: www.netflix.com/browse/genre/<code number>
        - Series en Movies hebben een uniek nummer, elk subgenre ook.
        - Voor de experimentomgeving is het waarschijnlijk prima om de routes gewoon 'series' en 'movies' te noemen.
- Hovering over an item does not change the URL, clicking on the arrow for more details does.
    - When the arrow is clicked, a variable value is added to the URL that contains the ID number of the item

- Amazon Prime does not allow a pop-up component for more details, and instead redirects to the following URL
    www.primevideo.com/detail/<item ID?>/<No idea what this is> to present the details

- HBO Max has the following URLs:
    - Front page: www.play.max.com
    - Series page: www.play.max.com/series
    - Movies page: www.play.max.com/movies
    - Specific show: www.play.max.com/show/<show ID>
    - Specific movie: www.play.max.com/movie/<movie ID>
    - Subgenre: www.play.max.com/<movies or series>?tab=<genre ID>
        - Note that the genre identifier is saved as a URL variable.
        - The genre ID differentiates between series and movies
        - Template genre ID: ?tab=<movies or series>-page-tab-emea-<genre name>

- HBO Max also does not work with the pop-up component for more details like Netflix, and rather uses the same
    type of approach as Amazon Prime does.


BASED ON INFORMATION ABOVE, THE FOLLOWING OTT-RELATED VIEWS ARE PROPOSED:
- Front page: www.testflix.com
- Series page: www.testflix.com/series
- Movies page: www.testflix.com/movies
- Specific show: www.testflix.com?<show ID> | www.testflix.com/<series or movies>/<show ID>
- Search page: www.testflix.com/search?q=<query>
    - Consider the possibilities performance-wise on how to implement this. Specifically these two options:
        1. (Netflix) Go to page if search bar has non-whitespace content, return to previous non-search page when search bar goes empty again.
        2. (HBO Max) Go to search page by clicking on search icon, then allow user to use queries. User will have to navigate to previous page
            manually to get back to the page they were at before clicking hte search icon.

- More details should be implemented through a pop-up component rather than a page change for performance.
